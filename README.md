# 👋 Hi, I'm Dhanyasri Bolla! 🌱  
**Graduate Research Assistant (GWU FEWS Lab) | Data Analytics & Policy Research | Urban Resilience & Sustainability**

---

## 📌 About Me  
I’m a Master’s student in **Engineering Management at The George Washington University (Dec 2025)** and a **Graduate Research Assistant at FEWS Labs (GWU)**. I work at the intersection of **climate adaptation, data analytics, and applied policy research**—building frameworks and tools that turn complex evidence into **decision-ready insights** for resilient cities and systems.

My strengths blend **technical skills (Python, R, SQL, Spark)** with **research depth (mixed-methods analysis, policy coding, statistical modeling)** and **systems thinking (SysML, Capella, decision modeling)**. I enjoy designing workflows and dashboards that make research usable for stakeholders.

## 🔬 Research & Projects (Selected)

- 🏙️ **Climate Adaptation in Megacities (GWU FEWS Lab)**  
  → Built a quantitative framework to analyze **43** global megacity climate action/adaptation plans  
  → Applied **chi-square**, **Cramer’s V**, and **regression** using `Python` + `Excel`  
  → Used **LLM-based textual analysis** to extract patterns and planning gaps  
  → Presented findings at **AGU 2024**: *Urban Giants Under Threat*

- Metadata-Driven Energy & Climate Data Lakehouse (AWS)
  → Architecture: Designed a serverless ingestion framework using `AWS Glue` (Python Shell) and `DynamoDB` to dynamically fetch data from disparate sources (XML/JSON APIs) without hard-coding logic.
  → Ingestion Engine: Built a resilient Python pipeline handling legacy API constraints (CAISO), implementing dynamic date parameter injection and automated SSL certificate handling for strict utility gateways.
  → Complex Transformation: Engineered a custom "Brute Force" XML parser in Python to resolve schema drift and namespace conflicts in energy data, normalizing it alongside nested weather JSON into a unified Silver Layer (Parquet).
  → Analytics & Insights: Leveraged `AWS Athena` (SQL) to perform cross-domain analysis, using ISO 8601 timestamp parsing to correlate solar radiation spikes with real-time grid load fluctuations.
  
- 🌿 **Global Adaptation Co-Benefits Mapping (GAMI)**  
  → Coded and categorized **430+** articles to map adaptation co-benefits (health, economy, biodiversity)  
  → Built repeatable coding + QA workflows for comparative analysis

- 🔎 **Web of Science Research Landscape Mapping**  
  → Automated publication extraction/cleaning (80+ records) and built visual summaries (treemaps, frequency charts)  
  → Highlighted cross-disciplinary trends supporting urban adaptation research

- 🧩 **Tracking Systemic Impacts of U.S. Foreign Aid Policy (Qualitative Codebook)**  
  → Conducted inductive analysis of **18 expert interviews**  
  → Built a **14-category codebook with 40+ sub-codes** for longitudinal tracking and synthesis

- 🌾 **What Our Region Grows 3.0 (USDA CoA + FAF Flows)**  
  → Automated USDA Census of Agriculture analysis (**2012 / 2017 / 2022**)  
  → Built CPI-normalized dashboards and analyzed inbound food-supplier flows using FAF SCTG

- ⚡ **San Diego Renewable Energy Transition Model (Capstone)**  
  → Modeled transition to **60% renewables by 2034** using CAISO data (2018–2025)  
  → Projected **~$1.56M annual savings** and **27,000+ metric tons CO₂/year reduction**

- 💡 **SwapStack – AI Fintech Hackathon 2025 (Cerebral Valley, NYC)**  
  → Built an AI-driven P2P lending concept with electronics as collateral  
  → Designed backend + database schema and developed API endpoints  
  → Focus: asset valuation + marketplace workflows + risk checks

- 🌍 **Climate Adaptation Memory Engine (RAG)**  
  → Built a RAG system over city adaptation plans with semantic search + metadata filtering  
  → Streamlit app + API for comparing resilience strategies across cities  
  → Designed safeguards to prevent duplicate ingestion and support iterative updates

- 🌐 **Kerala Tourism Website (Web Development Internship)**  
  → Built responsive UI components with `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`  
  → Improved performance via API optimization and cross-browser testing  

- 📈 **Marketing Analytics & Operations (Unschool)**  
  → Led campaign analytics and workflow improvements  
  → Reported impact: **+45% enrollments**, **+20% lead conversion**
