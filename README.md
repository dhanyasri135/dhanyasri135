# 👋 Hi, I'm Dhanyasri Bolla! 🌱  
**Graduate Researcher | Data Analyst | Urban Systems Thinker | Systems Engineer | Urban Sustainability Enthusiast**

### 📌 About Me  
I'm a Master’s student in **Engineering Management at George Washington University**, passionate about **data science, systems engineering, and climate policy modeling** to tackle complex urban challenges in **climate adaptation, urban resilience, and sustainable infrastructure**. My work focuses on the **intersection of analytics and sustainability**, using real-world data to model infrastructure resilience, climate adaptation, and stakeholder dynamics in megacities.

My journey bridges **technical expertise (Python, R, SQL, Spark)** with **research depth (climate adaptation frameworks, policy analysis)** and **system design (SysML, Capella, decision modeling**). I thrive on building **data-driven tools** that translate complex real-world problems into actionable insights.
